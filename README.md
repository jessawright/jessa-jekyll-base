# Jessa Jekyll Base

I used this repository to get a feel for Jekyll. Now it serves me as an ugly Jekyll starting point. It is ugly on purpose.

* I've removed the default minima theme that comes in a fresh Jekyll install so that I can write my own stylesheets and layouts. I've removed all syntax highlighting stylesheets.
* I followed [Tania Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) tutorial for setting up Jekyll. (It is pretty great!) That was mostly just a nice step-by-step setup guide, but she does change the organization of pages a bit from the Jekyll standard, which you can see in `_pages`. It is a nice way of organizing it that I like.

## Using this template

* To use this template, you need Jekyll installed ([instructions here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)).
* To serve Jekyll in a cloud IDE (I'm using Cloud9), use the command `jekyll serve --host $IP --port $PORT --` instead of `jekyll serve`.
